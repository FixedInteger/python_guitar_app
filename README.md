# Python Guitar Sound Generator

## Overview

This Python project is a simple guitar sound generator that allows users to input a specific guitar string frequency and hear the corresponding sound. It utilizes the NumPy and PyAudio libraries to generate and play sine wave audio signals.

## Features

- **Generate Guitar Sounds:** Enter a valid guitar string frequency to produce a sound resembling that of a guitar string.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust the duration and volume of the generated sound for flexibility.
- **Easy to Use:** A user-friendly command-line interface makes it simple to input parameters and listen to the generated sounds.
- **Educational:** Ideal for educational purposes, music enthusiasts, or anyone interested in understanding how different guitar strings produce distinct tones.
